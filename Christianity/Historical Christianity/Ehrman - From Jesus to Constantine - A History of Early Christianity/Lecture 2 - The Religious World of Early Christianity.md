## Overview

	- [[Alexander the Great]] - [[Constantine the Great]]
	- Kingdom conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] was split into regions that were ruled by his generals, Hellenistic culture remains for centuries
	- Eventually [[Roman Empire]] conquers the land previously conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]
- Vast majority of people in the [[Roman Empire]] were [[Pagan|Pagans]] who adhered to local and regional [[Cult|Cults]]
- Christians were called [[Atheists]] by the [[Pagan|Pagans]] because they didn't worship "the gods"
- Emperors were considered divine, but not to the extent of some of the higher [[Pagan]] Gods
- Religion for these people was not a matter of reaching the afterlife, Gods were important because they could help people *now*
- To keep the population constant, women in the [[Roman Empire]] had to have an average of 5 children due to death rates
- Gods were meant to help with things that humans could not impact
	- Motivating factor of was fear of the Gods, if they were not happy they could bring natural disasters
- Religion sought [[Pax Deorum]], didn't demand spirituality but rather ritual practice (prayer and sacrifice, primarily animals)
	- Sacrifice done in temples
	- Usually a celebration was set aside for sacrifices and was one of the few times people in antiquity ate meat
- Doctrine was not a major issue in [[Pagan]] religion
	- As a result, religions were highly tolerant of one another
