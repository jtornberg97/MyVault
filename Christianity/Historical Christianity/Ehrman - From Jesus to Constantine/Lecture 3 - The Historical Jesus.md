# The Historical Jesus
## Speaker & Source
- Speaker: [[Bart Ehrman]]
- Source: https://www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/from-jesus-to-constantine-a-history-of-early-christianity

## Overview
- [[Bart Ehrman|Ehrman]] says it is hard to reconstruct the life and words of [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] due to the lack of primary sources and writings
	- Argument that there is more information about [[Paul]] than Jesus
- [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] never mentioned in the compendium of other writings from the Roman Empire from the 1st Century CE
	- First documented reference to Jesus by a [[Pagan]] source was a letter in 112 CE by a Governor in the [[Roman Empire]] named [[Pliny the Younger]]
	- Then begins to appear more regularly
- Jewish sources Exist written by [[Josephus]]
	- 2 mentions of [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]]
		- 1 occasion he says that Jesus was a person with a great following, got on the "bad side" of some Jewish leaders who turned him over to [[Pontius Pilate]] in ~93-94 CE
			- Only reference to Jesus in the First Century CE
- Stories of [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] life were scarce outside of the [[Gospels]]
- [[Gospels]] are hard for historians
	- Anonymous, been ascribed to [[People/Matthew]] (disciple), [[John]] (disciple), Mark (secretary for [[Peter]])
	- Written in [[Greek]] but [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] spoke [[Aramaic]]
	- Based on oral tradition
	- [[Gospels|Gospel]] = Good News not historical fact
	- Hard to know what is historically accurate vs what has been changed to fit the church's theology
- [[Mark]] is likely the most historically accurate [[Gospels|Gospel]] as it was the first one written
- [[Apocalyptic Jews|Apocalypticism]] was a widespread movement in early Judaism including in and around the time of Jesus 
	- [[Bart Ehrman|Ehrman]] defines as "The belief that the present age was ruled by forces of evil, and that God would soon overthrow them in a cataclysmic act of judgement to bring in a Utopian Kingdom ruled by his own [[Messiah]]"
	- [[Bart Ehrman|Ehrman]] argues that [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] was an [[Apocalyptic]] teacher
	- i.e. [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]
	- Mark 1:15  ([[Mark]]) is the first teaching of Jesus, suggests that the Kingdom of God is at hand
- [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] referred to the coming Messiah as the [[Son of Man]]
	- In [[Daniel]], Prophet sees beasts coming to destroy but the [[Son of Man]] comes down and reigns
	- Mark 8:38 ([[Mark]])
	- Mark 9:1 ([[Mark]])
	- Coming judgement brings destruction of world order, reversal of fortunes
	- Appears to have expected this all to happen within his own generation
- [[Bart Ehrman|Ehrman]] argues that his ethical teachings were meant to prepare people for the coming kingdom in their lifetimes
- Jesus went to Jerusalem (i.e. heart of Judaism) in the last week of his life to share his teachings during [[Passover]]
	- Showing that the coming Kingdom would apply to [[Sadducees]]
	- [[Sadducees]] were trying to prevent an uprising during [[Passover]] as these had happened before
	- Handed Jesus over to [[Pontius Pilate]]
- Unlike all other [[Apocalyptic Jews|Apocalyptic]] teachers at the time, Jesus has followers who continued to believe him after his death (i.e. resurrection)

## Key Takeaways
- During the Second Temple period, Apocalypticism was not uncommon. Jesus was unique  because his followers were convinced that he rose from the dead.
